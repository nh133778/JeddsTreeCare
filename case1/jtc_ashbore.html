<p>• What is Emerald Ash Borer?

Emerald ash borer (EAB) is a beetle native to Asia that was introduced to Detroit, MI in 2002. It has destroyed tens of millions of true ash species in over 25 states, including Nebraska. Forests, windbreaks, and urban trees—some 44 million Nebraska ash trees—will be lost in the coming years. Many leading EAB researchers speculate that it has the potential to "functionally" wipe out the ash species with devastating economic and ecological impacts.</p>

<p>• Why should I be concerned?

EAB is able to kill all ash trees, regardless of their health, age or size. It has killed hundreds of millions of ash trees already in the U.S. As of July 2017, it was found in two locations in Nebraska: Omaha and Greenwood. EAB advancing westward across the state is not up for debate; what is unknown is how many years it will take.</p>

<p>• What does EAB look like?

Adults are green beetles approximately one-half inch long with slender bodies. Larvae are cream colored and up to 1 1/4 inch long. Larvae have brown heads and a 10-segmented body with bell-shaped segments near the back end.</p>
